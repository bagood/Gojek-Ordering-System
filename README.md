# Gojek-Ordering-System

This was one of the very first Python projects that I worked on. In this rather messy and unreadable program, I was trying to accomplish a similar task as Gojek for ordering their services. Working on this project made me realize just how important it is to utilize functions for better code readability. 

## Run

```
python3 gojekOrderingSystem.py
```
